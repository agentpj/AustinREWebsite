        <p> Welcome to your FREE and USER FRIENDLY, Austin real estate guide.</p>
        <p>You have enough to do when you are thinking about buying or selling a home. Why spend time learning how to
          page
          through a web site to find what you need. I have created this site for you, because I believe that buying and
          selling Austin real estate should be easy.
        </p>
        <p>Most agents sell homes, I am here to build a business, relationships and to help people.
          My real estate business has been built around one guiding principle: It's all about you. Any agent can sell
          you
          a home,
          I am different because I consider your needs, dreams, concerns, questions, finances, time and life.
          Home buying is more than a certain number of bedrooms in a particular zip code, this is about your life and
          thatâ€™s important to me!

        <h5>Testimonials from Our Clients</h5>

        <p>Received this testimonial after back to back closings (sell then buy). It was a bit of a challenge in this
          hot market but I was able to negotiate the idle deal not only was it higher than asking but a lengthly seller
          leaseback that allowed them time to find the right home knowing it would take awhile. We got a great deal on
          the buy side without dealing with multiple offers after a few in the beginning.
        </p>
        <li> Pearl is fantastic! She was with us when we bought our first house three years ago. I was six months
          pregnant, overwhelmed, and confused by the entire process. She helped my husband and I understand what to
          expect, how to prepare for all the different steps, and even after closing checked in on us to see how things
          were going. We had such a good experience the first time that when it was time to sell that house and buy a
          new one, she was the only person we thought about to help us with both transactions. Selling our house was an
          entirely new experience, and very difficult to do with a toddler! But Pearl was there to help us come up with
          strategies on how to stage/show the house and what to expect from the various buyers and their agents that
          would be coming through. She was there for every silly question or complaint that I had, and in the end we
          accepted an offer (one of many to choose from) after only three days on the market. I believe this is 100% due
          to her expertise in pricing and marketing. She walked us through the closing process as the sellers and helped
          us understand the different things that would be expected of us; again, always there to answer my silly
          questions.
          We were eager to start looking for our new house and she was quick to help us narrow down our search, take us
          to properties, and when we finally found the house we wanted she was unwavering in the negotiation and steps
          up to closing. There's a lot that goes on with concurrent selling and buying, and for the average homeowner
          it's not something we experience often so the process always feels new and overwhelming. My husband and I feel
          very fortunate that Pearl was there with us through it all. She made a very stressful experience one that was
          fun and satisfying. We always tell our friends that if they're going to be buying or selling, they need to
          call Pearl!
        </li>
        <p>So happy to have the oppportunity to help our law enforcers. Thank you for your kind words and your service.
          May I point out, the last part he mentioned? "Trust me". Who wouldn't trust an LEO? </p>
        <li>
          In 2021, I purchased my first home. The market was absolutely insane, as most of you may recall, and I could
          not have done it without a realtor like Pearl Jones representing me. Because I was a first time home buyer,
          the process seemed very overwhelming for me, and people told me that it would be one of the most stressful
          things I would ever go through. However, Pearl was there to help me through the process from start to finish.
          Since it was my first time, I had a lot of questions regarding the overall homebuying process and all of its
          twists and turns. Pearl was amazing about not only answering my questions, but explaining the answers to me in
          a dialogue that I could actually understand as well. The legal language that is used in the initial homebuying
          paperwork can certainly make it seem like youâ€™re reading in a foreign language. However, Pearl broke down each
          and every piece of literature and explained it to me from top to bottom. During the construction process,
          Pearl was amazing when it came to calling out the builder when something was not quite right. She was
          relentless in the most professional way when it came to making sure that I got every pennyâ€™s worth out of my
          home. Pearl was persistent with the builder when it came to correcting any discrepancies that needed attention
          and she was right there with me during every walkthrough that we conducted with the builder. Pearl was present
          at every meeting and was available to answer my questions day or night. Pearl was also right there beside us
          when we closed at the title company and warmed our hearts by providing us with an amazing house warming gift.
          If youâ€™re in the market and looking for a new home, you would be doing yourself an injustice by not letting
          Pearl Jones represent you. Call her, trust me!

        <li>Pearl is fantastic! The best relator that I have ever worked with. From the moment we started working
          together, she was easy to work with, quick, on top of it and very knowledgeable. She helped stage my house and
          navigate me through the process of selling, making the entire process smooth easy. We even had an offer on the
          house less than a day after it was on mls! When searching for a place to lease, she was quick to point out
          concerns and helped narrow down the types of places we'd be interested in. In a few years, I will be searching
          for a new house. When I do, I will definitely give her a call.

        <li>Pearl is AMAZING!
          This was our first time buying a house and Pearl made it so easy. She is very responsive and timely in her
          communications via phone, email or text. She recommended we go with her preferred lender and I am so glad we
          did because it saved us a TON of money, we can't thank her enough for that! There were a few times when we
          were waiting for documents from someone else and she would get on them until we got what we needed. What a joy
          to work with. Thank you Pearl we couldn't have done it without you.
