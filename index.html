              <strong>Financial pre-qualification or pre-approval</strong>
              You need to get pre-qualified before beginning your home search. Knowing exactly how much you can
              comfortably spend on a home reduces the potential frustration of looking at homes beyond your means.
              I can recommend loan officers that I have previously worked with if you are not currently working with
              someone.

  <h2> Here are some testimonials from our Clients:</h2>
  <p>I can't say enough good things about what Pearl has done for me. I was in my house for over 5 years. Times got
    gard. I
    was looking at a foreclosure and years of bad credit, dealing with tons of calls from the bank. Pearl came in
    and
    saved me. She dealt with both banks, and all the stress that goes with dealing with banks and financial
    institutes. I
    wish I would have met her sooner. No stress for me. She was upfront and honest about everything. It was not
    about the
    bottom line with her. It was all about doing the right thing. She has a great personality in any given
    situation. She
    got the job done quick.
    My credit was saved from foreclosure to a short sale. Pearl is an amazing broker and knows exactly what she is
    doing I
    will reconnect her to everyone I know I will certainly use her in the future. Great experience and again she
    is
    the
    stress buffer between you and your future.
    ~ Cindy
  </p>
  <p> Pearl Jones was a genuine and true professional when we asked her to help us with our short sale of our
    beautiful home. Our Situation was a bit precarious at best under the financial weight of needing to sell our
    home while facing a
    declining housing market and our own financial and medical issues. She was a light at the end of a foreclosure
    tunnel. With her knowledge I was able to depend on her and trust that our home would be sold and we would not
    have to
    foreclose. Pearl became a true friend and a realtor that I will come to again when itâ€™s time to buy or sell.
    Please feel
    free to call me as a reference. ~ Monica C., Bastrop, TX
  </p>
  <p>I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Pearl Jones because of her extensive knowledge as a

    If there is ever a time in your life where your faced with a short-sale, contact Pearl Jones. She will inform
    you what your options are. Pearl will guide you through every step of the way and makes the process
    comfortable. Pearl's
    knowledge of the market and attention to detail provided us with a smooth transction.
    Our home sold quickly because of her marketing skills. If your looking for a top-notch Realtor contact Pearl
    Jones.
    ~ Sincerely, Joe and Vel
  </p>
  <p>It was nice to work with you. You are so helpful on this case. I have a lot of short sale cases that fall
    apart. ~ Kimo (buyer's agent)
  </p>
  <p>I have been a Real Estate Broker for almost 20 years I have tended to steer clear of Short Sales because of
    several bad experiences in the past so when I first contacted Pearl Jones about a Short Sale she had listed, I
    was
    skeptical. I could not have been more wrong....
    Pearl was very knowledgeable; very honest; extremely diligent in dealing with the various entities involved;
    made sure that every detail of the sale was in place when we closed; and was able to get the Short Sale
    consummated in a
    time frame that frankly I did not believe would have been possible.
    I would HIGHLY recommend Pearl to any one contemplating doing a Short Sale far more than any other Short Sale
    agent I have ever had dealings with in the past. She was terrific! Thanks Pearl!!! ~ Sincerely, Robert Corwin
    (Real Estate Broker)

  <h5>Do you have a hardship?</h5>
  <p>Here are some reasons why past clients faced foreclosure. Do you have a similar circumstance? Know that you are not
    alone!
  </p>
  <li>A homeowner is going thru a divorce where the working husband has left the wife and the wife is ill,
    unemployed and is collecting disability. The wifeâ€™s disability payments are not enough to make the mortgage
    payments and to pay for food and bills.
  </li>
  <li>A husband is not able to work any longer due to a disability and is in need of regular treatments at the
    hospital. The wife is unable to work as she needs to take care of her sickly husband. The husband and wife
    have gone thru their savings in order to make their mortgage payments.
  </li>
  <li>Both spouses were living the American Dream by becoming successful business owners until the economy has
    forced their clients to cancel their contracts because of the slow economy. No business means no income. They
    were unable to pay their mortgage payments.
  </li>
  <li>A homeownerâ€™s mortgage has now converted to an adjustable rate, hence, inflating her mortgage payments to an
    amount she now couldnâ€™t afford.
  </li>
  <li>A spouse has passed away leaving credit card debt and high mortgage payments. The surviving spouse had
    become very ill. All the money left to the surviving spouse was used to pay the credit card debt and unable to
    make the mortgage payments.
  </li>
