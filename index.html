          <p>I can't say enough good things about what Pearl has done for me. I was in my house for over 5 years. Times got
            gard. I
            was looking at a foreclosure and years of bad credit, dealing with tons of calls from the bank. Pearl came in
            and
            saved me. She dealt with both banks, and all the stress that goes with dealing with banks and financial
            institutes. I
            wish I would have met her sooner. No stress for me. She was upfront and honest about everything. It was not
            about the
            bottom line with her. It was all about doing the right thing. She has a great personality in any given
            situation. She
            got the job done quick.
            My credit was saved from foreclosure to a short sale. Pearl is an amazing broker and knows exactly what she is
            doing I
            will reconnect her to everyone I know I will certainly use her in the future. Great experience and again she
            is
            the
            stress buffer between you and your future.
            ~ Cindy

          <p> Pearl Jones was a genuine and true professional when we asked her to help us with our short sale of our
            beautiful home. Our Situation was a bit precarious at best under the financial weight of needing to sell our
            home while facing a
            declining housing market and our own financial and medical issues. She was a light at the end of a foreclosure
            tunnel. With her knowledge I was able to depend on her and trust that our home would be sold and we would not
            have to
            foreclose. Pearl became a true friend and a realtor that I will come to again when it’s time to buy or sell.
            Please feel
            free to call me as a reference. ~ Monica C., Bastrop, TX
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>It was nice to work with you. You are so helpful on this case. I have a lot of short sale cases that fall
            apart. ~ Kimo (buyer's agent)
          </p>
          <p>I have been a Real Estate Broker for almost 20 years I have tended to steer clear of Short Sales because of
            several bad experiences in the past so when I first contacted Pearl Jones about a Short Sale she had listed, I
            was
            skeptical. I could not have been more wrong....
            Pearl was very knowledgeable; very honest; extremely diligent in dealing with the various entities involved;
            made sure that every detail of the sale was in place when we closed; and was able to get the Short Sale
            consummated in a
            time frame that frankly I did not believe would have been possible.
            I would HIGHLY recommend Pearl to any one contemplating doing a Short Sale far more than any other Short Sale
            agent I have ever had dealings with in the past. She was terrific! Thanks Pearl!!! ~ Sincerely, Robert Corwin

            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p> Pearl Jones, is a Real Estate Broker with 18 years experience in Texas Real Estate. After she was licensed in 2007, she received her first designation in real estate, Certified Default Resolution Specialist (CDRS).
              Pearl is one of the first agents to receive a short sale designation in southwest Austin. Pearl immediately
              started looking for clients who were in the risk of losing their home through foreclosure. Pearl has incredible patience as
              the short sale process is nothing short. The average short sale is 4 months for conventional loans, 2 months for FHA
              and VA
              loans.
              Short sale transactions require alot of paperwork, phone calls, documentation, negotiations, and a good
              understanding of what a lienholder needs in order to approve a short sale. Her due diligence, patience and
              empathy
              has made her successful in helping her clients. She has become a resource for agents all over Austin,
              inviting her
              to teach short sales to other agents and brokerages. Pearl also has also earned the following designations
              and
              certifications:
              e-Pro, ABR, MRP, CNE, and SSFR (Short Sale and Foreclosure Resource).

        <h5>Do you have a hardship?</h5>
        <p>Here are some reasons why past clients faced foreclosure. Do you have a similar circumstance? Know that you are not alone!
        </p>
        <li>A homeowner is going thru a divorce where the working husband has left the wife and the wife is ill,
          unemployed and is collecting disability. The wife’s disability payments are not enough to make the mortgage
          payments and to pay for food and bills.
        </li>
        <li>A husband is not able to work any longer due to a disability and is in need of regular treatments at the
          hospital. The wife is unable to work as she needs to take care of her sickly husband. The husband and wife
          have gone thru their savings in order to make their mortgage payments.
        </li>
        <li>Both spouses were living the American Dream by becoming successful business owners until the economy has
          forced their clients to cancel their contracts because of the slow economy. No business means no income. They
          were unable to pay their mortgage payments.
        </li>
        <li>A homeowner’s mortgage has now converted to an adjustable rate, hence, inflating her mortgage payments to an
          amount she now couldn’t afford.
        </li>
        <li>A spouse has passed away leaving credit card debt and high mortgage payments. The surviving spouse had
          become very ill. All the money left to the surviving spouse was used to pay the credit card debt and unable to
          make the mortgage payments.
        </li>
        <ul> Do you feel your area is immune from Short Sales? These areas saw short sales 10 years ago.</ul>
